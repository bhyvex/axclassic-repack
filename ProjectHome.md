**AX Classic** is all about retro play and custom content - there's a lot of custom content, but it's all in the Classic and Post (semi)-Classic zones. The bot- for-quests are really very simple - in fact, when Congdar created this quest-system, I simplified it even more for us, because our game exists in the old school zones, and some of the old expansions. Acquiring the bots at an earlier level opened the doors to all those great dungeons like Crushbone and Najena (at a level where the drops are of use). But , in order to keep it interesting, you still have to work somewhat for your bots. It's a nice feeling of accomplishment, when you finally get your bot :), or finish a quest for a spell. When I see someone with a bot raid group, I have respect for them because I know the worked for it. Like Les said - It's not that we're better than PEQ, We want to think that we have something a little different to offer you, so you can come play here and re-find your interest in EqEmu.<br><br>
<b>AX Classic</b> servers are capable of "Bot Raiding" - provided the player does the quests, he can have up to 65 bots in his raid group.<br><br>
<b>AX Classic</b> is compatible with 6x, Titanium, and SoF clients. Newer clients that work are SoD and Underfoot, but not with all their features since they stray away from the old-school game of Classic EQ.
